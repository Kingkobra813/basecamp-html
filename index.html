                    The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have
                    been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly
                    increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in
                    “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society,
                    have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings
                    to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering
                    (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and
                    have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The
                    continued development of technology will worsen the situation.
                    It will certainly subject human being to greater indignities
                    and inflict greater damage on the natural world,
                    it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological
                    suffering, and it may lead to increased physical
                    suffering even in “advanced” countries.
